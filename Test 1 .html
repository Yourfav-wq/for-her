      Devu, I know things have been tough lately. I know there are moments where everything feels heavy, where the world doesnâ€™t feel as kind as it should, and your heart feels a little too tired. But I need you to know that youâ€™re not alone. Youâ€™re never alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not a burden. You are not weak. You are not broken. You are human. And being human means feeling deeply, carrying emotions that sometimes feel too big to hold. But I believe in you. Iâ€™ve always believed in you. Your strength, your kindness, your love â€” they inspire me every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on the days when you canâ€™t see the light, I will be here holding a lantern for you. I will remind you of your worth when you forget it. I will stand by you through every storm, every quiet cry, every soft smile that tries to come back. Because thatâ€™s what love does. It stays.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your heart needs healing, let it heal. If your mind needs peace, take all the time you need. You donâ€™t have to rush. You donâ€™t have to pretend. You are already enough. And no matter what, I will be here â€” cheering for you, holding your hand, and loving you more every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are my peace, my dream, my golden hour. And even if the sky feels cloudy now, I promise you: your sun will rise again.
    </p>
